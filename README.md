# qcode
Qencode / Qdecode a file. Qencoding converts a file into an angry rant of the letter q.

An added benefit is that qencode vastly increases the file size with a factor of about 30.

Example qencoded message:

"be sure to drink your ovaltine." 

encodes to:

"qqqq QqQQqQqqqqQQQqqq qqqqqqqqQqqqQqq qqqqQQQqqQqqQQQq qqqQqQQ qqq qqqqqqQqqqqqq qqqqQqqq qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqQ qqqQqQQQQqqqQ qqqq Qqqqq qqqqQqQqQQqQqQ qQqqqQqqQqq qQqqqqqqQqQQq qQq QQqqQQqqQqq QqQqqqqqQq qq qqq qQqq qqQqQQQQqqqqq qQqqQqQ qQqqQqQ qqq qqqqqqqqqQqqQqq qqqqqqqqq qqqqqqqqqqqQQ Qqqqq QqQqQQq qqqqQ qqQqqQqqqqq qQQQqqqqqQqQqq qQQqQQqQQQ QQQQQQQQQQ! qqqqq Qqqqq qqqqQqqqqqqqqqqq qqqqqqqqqQQQqQqq qqqQQqqqqQqqQqQQ qqqqqq! qQQqqq QQqQqqqQQq qqqQQqqq qqqqqqqqqqqQq QQqqQqQqqQqqQQqQ QQqQqqQqQqQQqqQq Qqqqq qQQ QqqQQQQQQQQQQQ qqQQQqqqqQq qQqQqQQqQq QQQqQQQqQQQ QQqqqqqQQqqq qqqqqqqqqq qq qqqqq qqqqqqqqqqQqqQqq qqQQQqQ QQqQqQQqQqQQqqQ qQQqqqqqQQQqqQqq qQqQQQQQQQQQQQ QQQQQQqQ QqQqQ qqqqqqQqQ qqqqqQqqqQQQq q!
